Game - Chaser
Pippin Barr and RaÃºl Oropeza

A "simple" game of cat and mouse. The player is the democrat party and can move with keys,
if they overlap the (randomly moving) prey (voters) they "eat them" by sucking out its life
and adding it to their own. The player "dies" slowly over time so they have to keep
eating to stay alive.

Includes: Physics-based movement, keyboard controls, health/stamina,
random movement, screen wrap.
